They will also learn how variations in inheritance patterns arise, using analytical and statistical tools to distinguish between variations on inheritance patterns and to analyze quantitative traits. Then, students will focus in on the nucleus to examine the structure, organization, packaging, and inheritance of chromosomes.  They will consider the consequences of genetic recombination on inheritance patterns and for genetic mapping. They will zoom in even further to examine the molecular details of genetic processes: the regulation of gene expression, the basis of mutation and recombination, and the movement of transposable elements. With this background, they will consider the contributions of genome projects to genetics.  Finally, students will zoom out to the level of populations and analyze the genetic structure of populations and the contribution of genetics to evolution.  Usually offered Fall, Spring, Summer.",

Graduate students will learn how to create valid and reliable assessments; to interpret standardized test data; to build data models that identify student, classroom, program, and school needs; and in general, to systematically enhance educational decision making from a base of carefully collected information. Graduate students will also explore data collection and analysis strategies associated with technologies such as cloud computing, tablet computers and smart phones. In addition, they will experience data-driven decision-making models that can be integrated into student lessons to not only teach more effectively with data-driven decisions, but to also be able to teach students about data-driven decision making. The course will use real data sets and cases, in interesting, hands on and technology-rich activities, to help educators learn how to find the \"educational story\" represented by a set of carefully collected data points.",
